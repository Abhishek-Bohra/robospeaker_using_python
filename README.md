This line imports the pyttsx3 library, which is a Python library for text-to-speech conversion.<br>
This is a common Python idiom. It ensures that the code inside this block only runs if the script is executed directly, not if it's imported as a module.<br>
This line prints a welcome message to the console when the script is run.<br>
This line initializes the pyttsx3 engine. It's a one-time setup to prepare the engine for text-to-speech conversion.<br>
This starts an infinite loop that continuously takes user input.<br>
This line prompts the user to input text that they want the program to speak.<br>
It checks if the user input (converted to lowercase) is "q", indicating the desire to quit the program.<br>
If the user input is "q", the program uses the pyttsx3 engine to say "bye bye friend," runs the speech, and then exits the loop, ending the program.<br>
If the user input is not "q," the program uses the pyttsx3 engine to say the user input and runs the speech.<br>
This script creates a simple text-to-speech program that continuously prompts the user for input and speaks the input using the pyttsx3 library. It provides a farewell message and exits when the user inputs "q."<br>

In the pyttsx3 library, the runAndWait function is used to block the program's execution until all the currently queued speech is done. It essentially ensures that the program waits for the text-to-speech conversion to finish before moving on to the next line of code. This is important in scenarios where you want to synchronize the program's flow with the completion of the spoken text.
